## Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we start by creating the visualization of the web. We notonly need to analyze data and draw conclusions but we also need visualize data in order to
communicate findings to audience.
In other words, we use the power of JavaScript to create data visualizations that are attractive accessible, and interactiveusing Plotly.js.
A Javascript data visualization library like Plotly offers interactivity that increases audience comprehension which can help our audiences better 
understand your data and draw the same conclusions that we did. 

We also build our JavaScript foundation to manipulate, parse, transform data and build interactive features such as buttons and dropdown menu as well as 
to retrieve data from external sources like csv files, json and APIs. Finally, we diploy a polish data visualization to the web.

We use basic HTML, and basic JavaScript. 
The project is done as follows: 
   - Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart.
   - Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
   - Parse data in JSON format.
   - Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
   - Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
   - Use interactivity to enhance our visualizations.
   - Deploy an interactive chart to our GitHub Page.

## Summary
This project is summarized as the following using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js.:
1- Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 
2- Create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
3- Create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
4- Customize your dashboard with three of the following:
 - Add an image to the jumbotron.
 - Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
 - Make the webpage mobile-responsive.
