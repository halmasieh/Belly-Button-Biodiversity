## Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we start by creating the visualization of the web. We notonly need to analyze data and draw conclusions but we also need visualize data in order to
communicate findings to audience.
In other words, we use the power of JavaScript to create data visualizations that are attractive accessible, and interactiveusing Plotly.js.
A Javascript data visualization library like Plotly offers interactivity that increases audience comprehension which can help our audiences better 
understand your data and draw the same conclusions that we did. 

We also build our JavaScript foundation to manipulate, parse, transform data and build interactive features such as buttons and dropdown menu as well as 
to retrieve data from external sources like csv files, json and APIs. Finally, we diploy a polish data visualization to the web.

We use basic HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to build and style the entire page. 
The project is done as follows: 
   - Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
   - A written report on the UFO analysis 


## Resources
Software: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp)

library: Plotly


## Results
We provide a dynamic webpage by allowing users to filter UFO sightings on multiple criterias at the same time. The table filters included for date, city, sate, country and shape. Bundled into one tidy package, every sighting would be available for Dana (and her readers) to view. Although the created table is well organized, it is huge 
with hundreds of rows which is entirely too much for one person to reasonably look through and study. Therefore, using the filter feature, this possibility is provided
for group or individual search and enables the user to see, for example, all data related to the first of May in the US country as below:
